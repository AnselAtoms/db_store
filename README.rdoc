= DbStore

Be sure to add this to your gitignore:

db_store

to enable add to config/environments/development.rb (and any other environments you want):

DbStore.enable

You may have to require the file
require ...../db_storage (?)

at this point, you must have mysql and mysqldump installed to make this work.
